        <h2>A School In Your Community</h2>
        We have been serving families and children providing high quality Montessori education since 1991. Based on the philosophy and methodology of Dr. Maria Montessori, Montessori Children’s Community started with a Children’s House program. Over the past 28 years, under the watchful eye of School Head, Terri Modic, MCC has carefully developed each program. Today we offer a morning Children’s House program, an All Day program, a Lower Elementary Program, an Upper Elementary Program, and a Middle School Program.

From learning about micro economies and running their own class businesses to local field trips to learn about nature, the power of water, teambuilding, and more. &nbsp; MCC is so much more than just a school.&nbsp; My daughters have received an amazing education, while having experiences that have helped form the basis for the adults they will become.&nbsp; We are so pleased that we found MCC when we did.</span>
